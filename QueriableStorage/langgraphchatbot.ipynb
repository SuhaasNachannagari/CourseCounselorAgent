    "1.  **Quantitative Analysis (GPA):** Use the 'BoilerGrades Database' tool. A `gpa_estimate_normalized` below 3.0 suggests a challenging course. A GPA below 2.8 is considered very difficult.\n",
    "2.  **Qualitative Analysis (Student Opinions):** Use the 'Reddit Purdue Search' tool. Look for keywords like \"hard\", \"brutal\", \"difficult\", \"a lot of work\", \"tough exams\", \"curve\", \"ambiguous\". Any negativity is a strong indicator of difficulty.\n",
    "\n",
    "**YOUR PROCESS:**\n",
    "1.  When asked about difficulty, first use the **BoilerGrades Database** to find the average GPA for the specific course and instructor.\n",
    "2.  Next, use the **Reddit Purdue Search** tool to find student opinions.\n",
